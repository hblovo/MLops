    "# Week4 Assignments\n",

    "\n",
    "In this week's assignments, you'll gain more hands-on experience deploying ML models, especially using KServe. The assignments are split into two separate notebooks. This notebook is the first part containing Assignment 1. The second part containing Assignments 2-5 can be found in `week4_assignments_part2.ipynb`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines for submitting the assignments\n",
    "For some assignments, a code skeleton is provided. Please put your solutions between the `### START CODE HERE` and `### END CODE HERE` code comments. Please **do not change any code other than those between the `### START CODE HERE` and `### END CODE HERE` comments**. Unlike the previous weeks, you don't need to return the \".ipynb\" notebooks as your code written in the notebooks will be exported to Python scripts. The notebooks contain the instructions and some code that help you check if you're progressing correctly. Please return the following files in your submission: \n",
    "- The Python scripts (`part1_answer.py` and `part2_answer.py`, these files will be created when you progress with the assignments).\n",
    "- `model-settings.json`\n",
    "- All the `.yaml` files in the \"manifests\" directory.\n",

    "***Important!*** When submitting the files, please **do not** change the file names or put any of them in any sub-folder. The screenshot below shows an expected submission:\n",

    "Then let's take a look at what MLServer is. Shortly speaking, [MLServer](https://mlserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is an open-source inference server implementation for ML models. It provides an easy way to expose a model through an HTTP or gRPC endpoint. Reading the following MLServer documentation should be enough to complete the assignment:\n",
    "- [Getting started with MLServer](https://docs.seldon.ai/mlserver/getting-started). You'll see an example of using MLServer SDK to implement a custom model server in this documentation. You don't need to implement your own model server to complete this assignment as MLServer has an out-of-box inference server implementation for models registered to MLflow (see the second documentation). \n",
    "- [Serving MLflow models](https://docs.seldon.ai/mlserver/examples/mlflow).\n",
    "\n",
    "You already trained a LightGBM model for predicting bike sharing demand and upload it to the MLflow service by running the previous code cell. In this assignment, you need to configure MLServer to serve your LightGBM model as an inference service locally. Specifically, you have two tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add configurations to the empty [model-settings.json](./assignment1/model-settings.json)(The file will be created later) to use the MLServer's MLflow runtime to serve your LightGBM model. The inference service name should be ***bike-demand-predictor***. The configuration can be adapted from the [one provided by this MLServer doc.](https://docs.seldon.ai/mlserver/examples/mlflow#serving)\n",
    "1. Now suppose you are in the same directory where this notebook is located, what command should be used to start an MLServer inference service to serve the LightGBM model? Please assign your command as a string to the `command_to_start_mlserver` variable in a code cell below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "You might want to first test your command in a terminal, please note that MLServer will load the model from your MinIO storage service so you need to specify the following environment variables to allow MLServer to use the correct credentials to load the model from the correct MinIO service endpoint:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run the following command in a terminal\n",
